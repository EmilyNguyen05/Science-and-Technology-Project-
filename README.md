<h1>Hello! Thanking for looking at my project</h1>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p> I'm Emily, a student aspiring to become a data analyst in the future</p>
<h2> What is this?</h2>
<p>This is an app that aimed to help student get better in checking information they received from AI</p>
<p>It works by scraping websites from the user query</p>
<p>Then gives the website a score base on the following criteria</p>
- The domain
<div>- The website</div>
<div>- If it contains any words such as fake, conspiracy, unsured,... in it</div>
<h2>ATTENTION</h2>
<p> It is still a very rough and poorly optimize proof of concept</p>
